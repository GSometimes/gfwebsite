    Put your best foot forward at your next event with Good Foot Productions. 
    Create a memorable experience with entertainment that expresses you or your message.
    While we have booked entertainment at venues and festivals all over the world, we do not 
    have a roster of talent. Our only allegiance is to you and your vision. In fact, if we can’t 
    find entertainment that matches your vision, we’ll custom create a band for you.
<br />
Next Steps :
<br />
1st : Reach-Out!
<br />
2nd : Consultation. We’ll set up a consultation with you; phone, facetime or coffee meetup. 
Let us know what works best for you.
<br />
During your consultation, we’ll get to know a little bit more about you (or your company), 
your event, budget, etc… so that we can assist in building your vision.
<br />
3rd : The Reveal. We’ll send you entertainment options to review.
<br />
4th : The Winner is… You make your selection and we take care of the rest. 
From contract negotiations to technical riders/stage plots, AV, all advancing 
production needs. You write one check, we do the rest. So really, the winner is you.</p>
